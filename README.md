# StudentCalendar

StudentCalendar is an visual application that creates event icons under the days that you worked on.
Upload work days and hours into specific days and use that to calculate the amount of one's next paycheck
in addition to having it to create an invoice of the days selected.

## Purpose and Why?

The purpose of this calendar is to create a simple user interface that is easily navigated. 
Helping someone visualize and know about their next paycheck without manually calculating 
or trying to remember how many days/hours they worked.
